**Repository Analysis Request:**
Repository: ${repoInfo.owner}/${repoInfo.repo}
URL: ${githubUrl}

**Your Task:** Provide a professional, industry-standard audit estimation based on your extensive experience with similar projects.

**Analysis Framework:**
Apply your expertise in these areas:
- DeFi protocol security patterns and common vulnerabilities
- NFT marketplace and collection security considerations
- Cross-chain bridge and interoperability risks
- Governance token and DAO security models
- Oracle integration and price manipulation risks
- MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attack vectors
- Upgradeable contract security patterns
- Gas optimization and economic attack vectors

**Complexity Assessment Criteria:**
- **Simple**: Basic ERC-20/721/1155 tokens, simple staking, basic NFT collections
- **Medium**: DEX implementations, lending protocols, NFT marketplaces, multi-signature wallets
- **Complex**: Advanced DeFi protocols, cross-chain bridges, complex tokenomics, novel consensus mechanisms

**Pricing Benchmarks (2024 Market Rates):**
- Simple: $3,000 - $8,000 (2-4 days)
- Medium: $8,000 - $25,000 (5-10 days)  
- Complex: $25,000 - $100,000+ (10-30 days)

**Repository Context Analysis:**
Based on the repository name "${repoInfo.repo}" and owner "${repoInfo.owner}", infer:
- Project type and category
- Likely complexity level
- Common security patterns for this type of project
- Industry-standard audit scope and duration
