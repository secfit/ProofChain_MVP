# ProofChain Platform - Video Presentation Script

## üé¨ Video Structure (5-7 minutes)

### **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
*Visual: Animated blockchain network with security vulnerabilities*

**Narrator:** "Every day, billions of dollars flow through smart contracts. But here's the shocking truth: **over $3.8 billion was lost to smart contract vulnerabilities in 2022 alone**. The problem? Traditional auditing forces companies to expose their most valuable intellectual property to potential competitors."

*Visual: Split screen showing traditional audit process vs. ProofChain*

**Narrator:** "What if I told you there's a way to get world-class security audits while keeping your code completely private? Meet ProofChain."

### **The Problem (60 seconds)**
*Visual: Infographic showing industry pain points*

**Narrator:** "The smart contract auditing industry faces three critical challenges:

**1. Intellectual Property Risk**
- Companies must share proprietary algorithms with auditors
- Risk of IP theft and competitive advantage loss
- Prevents enterprise adoption of DeFi

**2. Trust and Transparency Issues**
- No cryptographic proof of audit quality
- Subjective audit standards
- Difficulty verifying auditor credentials

**3. Market Inefficiencies**
- Limited auditor pool due to geographic constraints
- High costs and long wait times
- No standardized pricing or quality metrics"

*Visual: Statistics overlay*
- "$3.8B lost to smart contract hacks in 2022"
- "Average audit cost: $15,000-$100,000"
- "Average wait time: 2-6 months"
